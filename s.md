Our Campaign Manager app uses the ads_read permission to retrieve essential campaign performance metrics (impressions, clicks, CTR, spend) through the Facebook Marketing API, enabling users to monitor their ad campaign performance in our unified dashboard. We sync and display this data to help users track campaign effectiveness and make data-driven optimization decisions across multiple advertising platforms from a single interface. The permission is used solely for displaying performance data to the campaign owner, with strict data handling practices ensuring no sharing with third parties. For the screencast demonstration, we will showcase the complete flow from Facebook account connection to viewing real-time campaign metrics in our dashboard. We fully commit to complying with Facebook's terms of service and usage guidelines for the ads_read permission.

Our Campaign Manager app requires the ads_management permission to provide a comprehensive advertising management platform that creates and controls Facebook ad campaigns programmatically through the Facebook Marketing API. This permission is crucial for our core functionality as it enables users to create, monitor, and optimize their ad campaigns across multiple platforms from a single interface. The app creates complete campaign structures including campaign settings, ad sets with detailed targeting parameters (demographics, interests, and locations), and ads with creative assets. Users can manage their daily budgets, schedule campaigns, upload creative assets (images/videos), set campaign objectives (brand awareness, reach, traffic, etc.), and receive real-time performance metrics (impressions, clicks, CTR, and ROI). This unified campaign management approach significantly streamlines the advertising workflow for marketers and businesses, saving them time and effort compared to managing campaigns separately on each platform's native interface.

Our Campaign Manager app is requesting the pages_read_engagement permission as it is a mandatory platform requirement by Meta for obtaining the ads_management permission, which is essential for our core advertising management functionality. While we do not directly utilize the pages_read_engagement or its dependent permission pages_show_list in our application features, these permissions are technically required by Meta's platform to access the ads_management capabilities. Our actual usage focuses solely on the ads_management permission for creating, monitoring, and optimizing ad campaigns through the Facebook Marketing API, including using the Conversions API and retrieving ads-related statistics.

Our Campaign Manager app is requesting the pages_show_list permission because it is a technical dependency required by Meta when requesting pages_read_engagement permission, which in turn is mandatory for obtaining the ads_management permission. While we do not directly use the pages_show_list permission in our application functionality, it is part of Meta's required permission chain to access the advertising management capabilities we need. Our app's actual usage is focused entirely on the ads_management features for creating and managing ad campaigns through the Facebook Marketing API.
