Based on my analysis of your Facebook integration issue, I've identified several potential causes for the error "This app isn't available. This app needs at least one supported permission." Let me provide a comprehensive solution to fix this problem.

The Issue
The error message indicates that your Facebook app either:

Doesn't have the required permissions configured
Is not properly set up for the user trying to connect
Has configuration issues with redirect URIs or app domains
Step-by-Step Solution
1. Check Facebook App Configuration
First, let's ensure your Facebook app is properly configured:

Log in to Facebook Developer Console:
Go to Facebook Developers
Select your app (the one with ID: 512708801911830)
Verify App Settings:
Go to "Settings" > "Basic"
Make sure your App Domains include: campaign-manager1271.netlify.app
Ensure the app is in the appropriate mode (Live or Development)
If in Development mode, make sure the user trying to connect is added as a tester
Check OAuth Redirect URIs:
Go to "Facebook Login" > "Settings"
Verify that https://campaign-manager1271.netlify.app/platforms is listed as a Valid OAuth Redirect URI
Make sure "Client OAuth Login" is enabled
Verify Required Permissions:
Go to "App Review" > "Permissions and Features"
Ensure that ads_management and ads_read permissions are added to your app
If your app is in Live mode, these permissions must be approved by Facebook
2. Check Backend Environment Variables
Make sure your backend has the correct environment variables:

Open your backend .env file
Verify these variables are set correctly:
Restart your backend server after making any changes
3. Test the Configuration
You can test if your Facebook configuration is correct by visiting:

This endpoint will show:

Whether your App ID is set in the backend
Whether your App Secret is set in the backend
Whether the App ID in the backend matches the one used in the frontend
4. Add Required Permissions to Your App
If your app doesn't have the required permissions:

Go to "App Review" > "Permissions and Features"
Click "Add" next to the following permissions:
ads_management
ads_read
Follow the instructions to request approval for these permissions
If you're just testing, you can use the app in Development mode with test users
5. Add Test Users (if in Development Mode)
If your app is in Development mode:

Go to "Roles" > "Test Users"
Click "Add" to add test users
Add the Facebook account you're trying to connect with as a test user
Only test users can use apps in Development mode
Additional Troubleshooting
If you're still experiencing issues:

Check Browser Console: Look for detailed error messages that might provide more information
Verify App Status: Make sure your app is not disabled or restricted
Check for API Changes: Facebook occasionally updates their API, which might require changes to your integration
Try with a Different Account: Test with a Facebook account that has admin access to the app
Conclusion
The most common cause of this error is missing permissions or incorrect app configuration. By following the steps above, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully connect your Facebook app.
